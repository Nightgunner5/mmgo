	<h1 id="focus">Focus</h1>
	<p>Driven by swift reflexes and quick thinking, thieves and archers deal
	damage in short, quick bursts before vanishing in the shadows. Focus,
	unlike most power sources, is used up very quickly, but also regenerates
	very quickly.</p>

	<h1 id="primal">Primal</h1>
	<p>Drawing power directly from primal instincts causes barbarians and
	druids to become more powerful as the battle grows longer. Primal-powered
	classes are focused on resource generation, as the taste of blood causes
	them to be able to continue, stronger, in battle.</p>

	<h1 id="ethereal"><small>Special case:</small> Ethereal</h1>
	<p>Ethereal have no power source; instead, each Ethereal ability has its
	own independent cooldown. The focus of an Ethereal is not to conserve any
	resource, but to use the right cooldowns at the right times.</p>
